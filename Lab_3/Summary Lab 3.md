## **Introduction**

This lab focused on understanding and implementing various IP addressing schemes including IPv4, IPv6, public, and private addresses. Emphasis was placed on configuration, subnetting, and addressing methodologies required for modern networking.

---

## **Learning Objectives**

- Explain and implement private IP addresses  
- Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes  
- Apply IPv4 subnetting solutions  
- Understand IPv6 concepts including SLAAC and EUI-64  
- Use loopback, broadcast, and default gateway IPs in troubleshooting

---

## **Lab Summary**

The lab explored four major areas:
1. IP Addressing Schemes and manual configuration  
2. Differences between IPv4 and IPv6  
3. Subnetting and binary conversion techniques  
4. Advanced IPv6 concepts including VIPs and subinterfaces

## **Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: IP Addressing Schemes**

- Manually configured static IP addresses  
- Investigated APIPA and dynamic addressing behavior

📌 *Key Takeaway:* Private IP addressing is crucial for internal networks and conservation of global IPs.

---

### **Exercise 2: IPv4 & IPv6 Addressing Solutions**

- Compared format, capacity, and APIPA behavior of IPv4 vs IPv6  
- Demonstrated ping tests to IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses

📸 *Insert Screenshot: PowerShell Loopback Tests*  
📌 *Key Takeaway:* IPv6 improves scalability and supports auto-configuration for large networks.

---

### **Exercise 3: IPv4 Subnetting Solutions**

- Differentiated classful vs classless addressing  
- Used subnet cheat sheets and CIDR notation to allocate addresses

📸 *Insert Screenshot: Subnet Cheat Sheet, CIDR Table*  
📌 *Key Takeaway:* CIDR allows efficient use of IP addresses in custom-sized networks.

---

### **Exercise 4: IPv6 Concepts**

- Reviewed EUI-64, unicast, multicast, anycast  
- Identified default gateway and VIP configuration

📸 *Insert Screenshot: Default Gateway Config via ipconfig /all*  
📌 *Key Takeaway:* IPv6 brings innovations like EUI-64 and SLAAC to reduce administrative overhead.
