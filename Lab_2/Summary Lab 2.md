## **Introduction**

This lab introduced the concept of network topologies and their characteristics, emphasizing both physical and logical designs. Various topologies such as mesh, star, bus, ring, and hybrid were explored using the LibreOffice Draw application. The lab aimed to enhance understanding of network layout designs and connectivity models.
